* ynl-mirror

A PoC to listen to netlink notifications and use them to mirror state to an
"offload" data path. This PoC uses the [[https://github.com/redhat-et/ekho-qemu][ekho-qemu lab]] as a mock test environment.

~server.py~ registers for rtnlgrp-ipv4-route notifications and converts them
into equivalent routes to configure on the "dpu" data path.
