# opi-k8s-networking
The goal of this repo is to hold all the documentation related to the OPI Kubernetes Networking
offload API. This includes:

- The use cases that are of interest to Red Hat in terms of xPU offload.
- The high level sequence diagrams of how we think those use cases should be implemented.
- The high level sequence diagrams of how OpenShift DPU offload works today.

The idea is that from all this documentation we can put together a proposal of where the OPI
Networking APIs should live and what they should look like.

Our guiding principle throughout is to reuse as much as possible of existing APIs where possible.
